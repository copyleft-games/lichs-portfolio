      Choose how long to slumber. Decades pass in an instant.
      But beware - events may occur while you sleep. Kingdoms
      rise and fall. Agents age and die.

      Before slumbering, you may set dormant orders. These are
      instructions your agents will follow while you sleep.
      Reinvest profits, sell failing assets, respond to events.
